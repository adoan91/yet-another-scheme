Exercise 2
Write following functions using tail recursive.
1. my-reverse that reverse the order of list items. (Function reverse is pre-defined.)
2. Summarizing items of a list consisting of numbers.
3. Converting a string that represents a positive integer to the corresponding integer, i.e. "1232" â†’ 1232. Input error check is not required.
Hint:
   1. Character to number conversion is done by subtracting 48 from the ASCII codes of characters #\0 ... #\9. Function char->integer is available to get the ASCII code of a character.
   2. Function string->list is available to convert string to a list of characters.
